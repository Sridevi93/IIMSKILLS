# Neural Networks - Revolutionalizing Technical Writing
---

## Introduction
Neural networks, also known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a type of machine learning algorithm that are designed to recognize patterns in data. 
They are modelled after the structure and function of the human brain, with interconnected nodes, or "neurons", that work together to process information.

## What are Neural Networks used for?
Neural networks have several use cases across many industries, such as the following:
- Medical diagnosis by medical image classification
- Targeted marketing by social network filtering and behavioural data analysis
- Financial predictions by processing historical data of financial instruments
- Electrical load and energy demand forecasting
- Process and quality control
- Chemical compound identification
